# *Important*
To run the calculations, you will need to download Eigen library at http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page. After that, go to the project file AirfNoise.pro and substitute the path INCLUDEPATH += "/home/martuscellifaria/Downloads/eigen-3.3.7" for any of your preference.

With this app, you can run airfoil turbulent inflow noise prediction and compare it to measurement data in the same environment.

In this current version, the user can export the chart as a .png file.

Further updates are to export the chart data as .csv and generate a statistics log regarding prediction error compared to the experiment.

The application is based on the author's ongoing PhD research and you can get more detailed info in the article "A rapid distortion theory-based airfoil turbulent inflow noise prediction method", published in the Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, at https://rdcu.be/b5uAF or e-mail me at martuscellifaria@gmail.com.
